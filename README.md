I'm stgiga, and I've been involved in technology for many years.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on various projects, though the most current thing I'm working on is UnifontEX, (at least until September 12th, 2023.)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java properly.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on extending the SoundFont format.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with keeping my code running long-term.
- 💬 Ask me about the various stories I have of the technology scene.
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm pretty much on most platforms, but http://stgiga.carrd.co has most of my socials, or sites that lead to my non-URL ones.
